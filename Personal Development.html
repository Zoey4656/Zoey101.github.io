        <h6 style ="color: #ffffff; font-family: Cambria; font-size: x-large;">12 Pillars </h6>
        <h6 style ="color: #e8e8e8; font-family: Cambria; font-size: large;">Chapters 4 -7 </h6>
        <p1 style="font-size:large;color: #ffffff; text-align: center; text-wrap: break-word; font-family: Georgia;font-style: italic;">The story begins with Michael and Charlie
             meeting at Mack's Diner, a small, local diner. Charlie talks about his work at Twelve Pillars and how he enjoys taking care of things. Michael shares a story about how he used gardening 
             metaphors to improve his relationship with Amy. Charlie then discusses goal-setting with Michael, emphasizing the importance of writing down goals and the personal growth that comes from achieving them. 
             Charlie provides Michael with a goal-setting framework, including long-range, mid-range, and short-range goals.The conversation continues with Charlie emphasizing the importance of avoiding the pain of
             regret by taking action on goals. He stresses the urgency of time and the need to be the master of one's own life. Michael acknowledges that he needs to prioritize his time and focus on important goals.
             As Michael leaves, Charlie encourages him to visit again soon. In the next chapter Michael and Charlie discuss the importance of surrounding oneself with positive influences. Charlie emphasizes the power
             of association and how it can shape one's attitude and destiny. He introduces the concept of categorizing relationships into disassociation, limited association, and expanded association. Michael struggles
             with the idea of potentially limiting or disassociating with his long-time friends. Charlie encourages him to consider the impact of these relationships and the potential benefits of seeking new associations
             with more successful people. In chapter 7 the conversation continues with Charlie discussing the importance of lifelong learning and self-education. He emphasizes that formal education is not enough for success 
             and that self-education is crucial. Charlie recommends reading books as a valuable tool for learning and personal growth. Michael initially expresses skepticism about reading books, but Charlie persuades him of
             their importance. Charlie gives Michael a list of recommended books and insists that he read one before their next meeting. Michael agrees to read The Magic of Thinking Big and feels a sense of warmth and appreciation for Charlie's guidance.</p1> <br></br>

             
            <p1 style="font-size:large;color: #ffffff; text-align: center; text-wrap: break-word; font-family: Georgia;font-style: italic;">Based on what I’ve read, the chapters provide valuable insights into personal and professional growth. 
                In order for me to apply these lessons effectively, I must focus on setting clear goals, surrounding myself with positive influences, and continuously learning. Additionally, prioritise my tasks based on their importance rather than just their urgency, 
                and design my life plan to take control of my time. Furthermore, evaluate my relationships to determine their impact on my life and seek positive associations that inspire and support me and also embrace challenges as opportunities for growth, cultivate a positive attitude, 
                and persevere through setbacks. By applying these principles, I’ll be able to make significant strides towards achieving my goals and living a fulfilling life.</p1> <br></br><br></br>
