        <p1 style="font-size:large;color: #ffffff; text-align: center; text-wrap: break-word; font-family: Georgia;font-style: italic;">Steven's unwavering determination is a mirror image of my own resilience. Like him, I’ve consistently overcome seemingly insurmountable challenges. Even when faced with tight deadlines and complex concepts, I’ve 
            persevered, pushing through obstacles to complete my assignments and coursework. This shared trait of determination has been instrumental in our shared successes. </p1> <br></br>

        <h6 style ="color: #ffffff; font-family: Cambria; font-size: x-large;">Who Inspires Me</h6>,<br></br> 
        <p1 style="font-size:large;color: #ffffff; text-align: center; text-wrap: break-word; font-family: Georgia;font-style: italic;">“Until I get what I want I will not give up. Well, not giving up is my weapon!” - Asta (Black Clover).This quote is from the Japanese animated series called Black Clover written by Yūki Tabata. The series focuses on Asta, 
            a young orphan who is left to be raised in an orphanage alongside his fellow orphan, Yuno. While everyone is born with the ability to utilize mana in the form of magical power, Asta, who has no mana and thus no way to use magic, instead focuses on physical strength. Conversely, Yuno was born as a prodigy with immense magical power and the talent to control wind magic. Motivated by a desire 
            to become the next Wizard King, an authority figure second to the king of Clover Kingdom, the two youths developed a friendly rivalry. Yuno obtains a legendary four-leaf grimoire held by the kingdom's first Wizard King. The four-leaf grimoire is a rare grimoire, only given to the most immense mages. Asta, despite his lack of magic,
            obtained an enigmatic five-leaf grimoire that contains mysterious elf swords and a bodiless member of the Devil race who utilizes rare anti-magic. Afterward, he and Yuno each join a Magic Knight squad as the first step to fulfill their ambitions (Wikipedia contributors, 2024).</p1> <br></br>

            <p1 style="font-size:large;color: #ffffff; text-align: center; text-wrap: break-word; font-family: Georgia;font-style: italic;">Asta was selected as my hero because throughout the series he faced so many hardships, so many obstacles; he was outcasted because of his lack of magic, no one wanted to be his friend. They thought he was pathetic for not having magic and they thought him worse for trying
                to become the wizard king, however, despite all the negative towards him, Asta continued to train and push his body to the limit, even when he himself was unsure of his path to becoming the wizard king. In order to become a wizard king, one need to be chosen by a grimoire - the grimoire analyzes your magic then selects you if your magic is strong enough. When it was Asta's time for grimoire selection, 
                he didn't recieve a grimoire as he had no magic. But he wasn't perturbed by this, he still believed in his dream. Eventually, he was selected by a unique grimoire, the series then goes on to show how he to beat the odds, became a powerful mage and continued getting closer to his dream despite all things in his way.</p1><br></br>

            <p1 style="font-size:large;color: #ffffff; text-align: center; text-wrap: break-word; font-family: Georgia;font-style: italic;">I find it challenging to accept the validity of personality tests that categorize individuals into specific groups. I believe each person possesses a unique personality, shaped by a multitude of factors. While we may share common traits with others, our individual
                 experiences and perspectives make our personalities truly distinct and singular.While I initially questioned the accuracy of personality tests, my results were surprisingly spot-on. The test accurately identified many of my key attributes, which left me impressed and intrigued. It seemed to capture the nuances of my personality in a way I hadn’t expected.</p1><br></br><br></br>
